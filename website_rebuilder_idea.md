- open website
- identify all colour values
- those values cannot be used later
- for each div, draw a boarder of a known, but unique colour
- if a button, or anchor is found -> border the parent element with a reserved indicator color
- repeat until the entire page is "bordered", and save a screenshot of that image
- from L->R, T->B use the known colour values to screenshot select elements of the main screenshot to build the uninteractive elements. 
- for each button, assign this a button tag and save the image
- rebuild the website with image references and 'kindle friendly' buttons
- fucking disgusting
